# Amazon Web Services ("AWS") Bootstrapping

In order to get started with this basic AWS + Kubernetes infrastructure fabric three things are absolutely required: 

1. An Amazon Web Services ("AWS") account.
2. An AWS user account with administrator privileges that allow you to provision the infrastructure fabric.
3. Install the official AWS command line toolchain.

## Get an AWS account

If you're part of an organization you should check and see if you're already paying for an AWS account and if you are then you can skip to [Setup an AWS user and API access](#Setup an AWS user and API access). If you do not already have an AWS account then you can follow these handy instructions to get on the right path:

1. Goto https://aws.amazon.com/
2. Select "Create an AWS Account"
3. Follow the instructions provided by Amazon.
